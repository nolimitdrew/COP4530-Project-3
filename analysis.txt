 Using the worst-case run-time complexity, the Big O for the clear() function in this instance 
 would be O(n) because the member/private data is NOT being de-allocated via delete in the destructor, 
 instead using the clear() function which is linked to the destructor, 
 only setting the stack to empty, not deleting the stack or modifying any other data, thus it being O(n).
